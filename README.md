# TED Engine

**This engine should not be used, features are missing, things are broken, breaking changes will happen.**

WebGL and TypeScript based game engine, primarily built for me to use during game jams and to learn more about WebGL.

- [`packages/ted`](packages/ted) contains the engine itself
- [`apps/docs`](apps/docs) contains documentation including some simple examples

## Commands

```

Serve the docs with:
