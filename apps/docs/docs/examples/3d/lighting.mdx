# Lighting

Example showing ambient and directional lighting.

Use the sliders to adjust strength of the ambient light, and the direction of the directional light.

You can click and drag to rotate around the scene.

:::info
The shadows in this example sometimes have some artifacts, this is due to the limited precision of the shadow map.

This will be improved in future versions of the engine.
